About the scenario and the services that are running on the server is important to consider:

[1] SSL offload and proxy, some important metrics to monitor are:
  - Load Average
  - Network throughput
  - Disk IOPS
  - CPU, Disk and Memory Usage
  
[2] To monitor these informations, a zabbix agent must be installed in the server, using modules or parameters to define exactly what need to me monitored.
    The zabbix server, must receive the information and have configured triggers to efficiently monitor the resources and take automatic actions or alarm, depending the configuration of each parameter.

[3] I believe the challenging in monitoring this server is about the high number of requests per second what makes a small problem can turn into a big catastrophe in seconds if anything go wrong. This contributes to the need to have a perfect observability and a quick response to put the things back in tracks.
